# Face-Recognition


result:

Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem
Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition
Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem
Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model
Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings


Problem statement:


Face recognition problems commonly fall into one of two categories:

Face Verification "Is this the claimed person?" For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.

Face Recognition "Who is this person?" For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.
